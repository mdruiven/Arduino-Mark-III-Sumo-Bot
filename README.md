# Arduino-Mark-III-Sumo-Bot
This repository contains the code and other files for an Arduino based Sumo bot driven by 2 continuous rotation servos. The bot also uses forward looking IR sensors and downward looking line sensors.
2 continuous rotation servos connected to 9 and 10.
2 Sharp IR 2YOA21 forward looking sensors on A3 and A4.
3 downward facing QRB1134 sensors a few mm above the surface, arranged in a line at the front of the bot and connected to A0, A1 and A2.

The original Mark III robot was designed by the Portland Area Robotics Society and sold as a kit through Junun.org. I have modified the original OOPIC kits to run on an Arduino with a custom made shield. 



Still need to add schematic and Fritzing files for board.

MarkIIIPixy files contain code to operate the Mark III with a Pixycam.
